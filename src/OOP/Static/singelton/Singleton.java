/* What is the Singleton Design Pattern?
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the entire application.
It also provides a global point of access to that instance.
Key Features:
Single Instance: Only one object of the class is created.
Global Access: The single instance can be accessed globally (using a method like getInstance()).
Controlled Creation: The class itself controls the creation of its instance by using a private constructor.
 Why Use the Singleton Design Pattern?
There are certain situations in software development where you need only one object of a class. Examples include:

Resource Management:

You might need to restrict resource access, such as a database connection or file system access.
Creating multiple instances might waste memory or create inconsistency.
Centralized Control:

A Singleton is often used for managing configurations, logging, or caching.
Since only one object exists, it acts as a centralized controller.
Global State:

If you want a shared state (like app settings), a Singleton can hold that state and ensure consistency.

How Does It Work?
The Singleton pattern uses these techniques to ensure there is only one instance:

Private Constructor:

The constructor is declared private. This prevents other classes from directly creating an object of the Singleton class using new.
Static Instance Variable:

A static variable holds the single instance of the class.
Static variables are shared across all instances of the class.
Public Static Method (getInstance):

A public method provides controlled access to the Singleton instance.
If the instance does not exist, it creates one. If it exists, it returns the existing instance.

The Singleton Design Pattern is one of the most commonly used design patterns in software development, and it serves a very specific purpose. Let me explain everything about the Singleton pattern and your code in detail, step by step.

Code Walkthrough
Hereâ€™s the code you provided with an explanation:

Singleton Class
java
Copy code
package OOP.Static.singelton;

public class Singleton {
    // 1. Private Constructor
    private Singleton() {
        // This ensures no external class can create an instance using "new Singleton()"
    }

    // 2. Static variable to hold the single instance of the class
    private static Singleton instance;

    // 3. Public static method to provide global access to the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        // Lazy initialization: Create the instance only if it is null
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton(); // Create the single instance
        }
        return instance; // Return the instance
    }
}
Explanation:
private Singleton():

This makes sure no other class can create an object of Singleton using the new keyword.
The Singleton class controls its instantiation.
private static Singleton instance:

This is the variable where the single instance of the class is stored.
It is static, so there is only one copy of this variable shared across the application.
public static Singleton getInstance():

This method allows access to the single instance.
If instance is null (i.e., no instance exists), it creates the instance.
If instance already exists, it simply returns the same instance.
This is called lazy initialization because the instance is created only when it is needed.

Main Class
java
Copy code
package OOP.Static.singelton;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Access the Singleton instance using the getInstance() method
        Singleton obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton obj2 = Singleton.getInstance();

        // Check if both references point to the same object
        if (obj1 == obj2) {
            System.out.println("Both objects are the same instance");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Different instances exist");
        }
    }
}
Output:
sql
Copy code
Both objects are the same instance
How It Works Step by Step:
When you call Singleton.getInstance() for the first time, the instance variable is null.

The method creates a new Singleton object and assigns it to instance.
The second time you call Singleton.getInstance(), the instance variable is not null.

The method simply returns the already created object.
Both obj1 and obj2 point to the same object, as confirmed by the equality check.

Key Benefits of Singleton
Memory Efficiency:

Only one instance of the class is created, saving memory.
Global Access:

You can access the Singleton instance from anywhere in the application.
Thread Safety (when implemented properly):

Ensures a single instance is shared even in multi-threaded environments.                           */
