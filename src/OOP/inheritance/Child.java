        /* Inheritance Hierarchy:
The Box constructor only copies properties of Box (l, h, w) because that's all it knows about.
Even though the Child object is passed, the Box constructor sees it as a Box instance,
not as a Child instance.
           The additional properties of the child (strength) are not accessible to the parent because:
The parent class doesnâ€™t "know" about the child class.
Java inheritance ensures encapsulation by restricting access to only the parent-defined members.*/

        super(l,h,w);
        //The super() call must always be the first statement in a constructor.
        // it will call a constructor matching these arguments
        // Anothere use case of super keyword

/*  Why is super Used?
Accessing Parent Class Members:

To resolve ambiguity when a derived class has members (variables or methods) with
the same name as those in the parent class.

Calling Parent Class Constructors:

To explicitly invoke a parent class constructor from a subclass.
Overridden Method Access:

To call a method from the parent class that has been overridden in the subclass.
